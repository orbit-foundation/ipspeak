# IPSpeak Roadmap
_This is our plan for versioning and updates in the future for IPSpeak. We've split the run-up to v1.0 into 3 phases: pre-release UI design, JavaScript construction and finalization._

## Phase 1: Pre-release UI Design

### v0.1.1
* Initial Commit: source CSS and HTML UI files for multi-chat concept

### v0.1.2
* Upload updated UI files with font and colour optimisation
* Begin compiling basic JavaScript
* Upload new view Bugout.js view


## Phase 2: JavaScript construction

### v0.1.3
* Add JavaScript chat choice module

### v0.1.4
* Debug existing JavaScript
* Add exitChatRoom function


## Phase 3: Finalization

## v0.1.5
* Make any last-minute changes

## Milestone: v1.0.0

## Future plans
We plan to release the stylesheets seperately with v2.0 of IPSpeak. In this package some JS elements will be included, because we're goi to start creating new DOM elements after v1.0's release.

As for the multi-chat interface prototyped in v1.1, we will begin the transition from Bugout.js to Socket.io after the first stable release.
